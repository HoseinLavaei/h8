// There are sixteen named "Flag" registers named (these bits are all in a register named xflag):
CF: Carry flag (Set if an unsigned operation generates a borrow, clear otherwise)
OF: Overflow flag (Set if a signed operation generates an overflow, clear otherwise)
SF: Sign flag (Set if a signed operation result is negative, clear otherwise)
ZF: Zero flag (Set if an operation result is zero, clear otherwise)
AF: Adjust flag (Set if an unsigned operation generates a half carry, clear otherwise)
TF: Trap flag (Set to allow single-step debugging, clear otherwise)
IF: Interrupt Flag (Set to enable interrupts, clear otherwise)
DF: Direction flag (set to move strings backward, clear for forward)
WPF: Write-protect flag (if set, you can't write to read-only memory pages)
GEF: Greater or Equal flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Greater" or "Equal")
GF: Greater flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Greater" set, clear otherwise)
EF: Equal flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Equal" set, clear otherwise)
IXF: InExact flag (if last operation's result is rounded set, clear otherwise)')
EXF: Exception flag (if last operation has resulted in raising any exception)
// NOTE: The processor doesn't set or clear these flags, it just checks if they are set or not. The assembler sets or clears'
// These two flags or not of GEF and GF and are handled by the assembler not the processor
LF: Less flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Less" set, clear otherwise)
LEF: Less or Equal flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Less" or "Equal" set, clear otherwise)
// Access mode is 2-bit flag that makes four access modes. 0: kernel mode. 1: root mode. 2: user mode. 3: vm mode. These flags can be changed manually, with instructions
