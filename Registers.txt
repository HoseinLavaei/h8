ZF: Zero flag (Set if an operation result is zero, clear otherwise)
AF: Adjust flag (Set if an unsigned operation generates a half carry, clear otherwise)
TF: Trap flag (Set to allow single-step debugging, clear otherwise)
IF: Interrupt Flag (Set to enable interrupts, clear otherwise)
DF: Direction flag (set to move strings backward, clear for forward)
WF: Write-protect flag (if set, you can't write to read-only memory pages)
GEF: Greater or Equal flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Greater" or "Equal")
GF: Greater flag (if last comparing operation's result is "Greater" set, clear otherwise)
