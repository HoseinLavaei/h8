# h8 CPU architecture
## _A modern 8-bit CPU architecture_

H8 is a modern 8bit CPU architecture built from scratch to solve modern little issues. It is from the H CPU family made by H foundation.

## Features
The details of the cpu registers, flags, instructions, etc. can be found in the files of this project. But H CPU family is built from scratch so it can include features of so many famous and unfamous other cpu architectures and is built to not include the downside of them when possible. It is a CISC architecture, but because of its simple design, it needs little electricity and can be used in "IOT" and "Embedded."

One of the most important features that h8 has is its speed compared to other 8-bit architecture. H8 CPU can have any frequency, but they are specially built to have high frequency unlike other 8-bit CPUs.
